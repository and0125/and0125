# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Aaron Dantley @and0125.

## Career Objective

Efficient problem-solver with experience in data engineering and data science, systems engineering, ETL
and API development roles, with proven knowledge of statistical analysis and data visualization, cross-
functional team building and leadership, as well as technical writing and communication. Aiming to
leverage my skills as a data scientist and engineer.

## Personal Statement and Current Projects

Iâ€™m interested in exploring the uses of python in web development and as a part of a larger, enterprise tech stack. Specifically, in building web applications and APIs with `django` and `django-rest-framework`. 

Iâ€™m currently learning how to utilize `django` with different databases, in order to understand the use-cases for different database options. 

Also, I am planning my career to learn more about data engineering, infrastructure as code, and AWS services, which will appear in later projects.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on website development, and am currently researching the tech stack and deployment methods for some personal projects.
