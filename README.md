# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Aaron Dantley @and0125.

## About Me

I'm an efficient problem-solver with experience in project/product management, data engineering and data science, systems engineering, ETL and API development roles. Combined with a proven knowledge of statistical analysis and data visualization, cross-functional team building and leadership, as well as technical writing and communication. Aiming to leverage my skills into technical product management, focusing on data science/data engineering roles.

## Personal Statement and Current Projects

Iâ€™m interested in exploring the uses of python in web development and as a part of a larger, enterprise tech stack. Specifically, in building web applications and APIs with `django` and `django-rest-framework`. 

Iâ€™m currently learning how to utilize `django` with different databases, in order to understand the use-cases for different database options. The bulk of my work in `django` has been in my current position as the API development lead for an internal project at Deloitte. The projects here are projects to encapsulate some of what I've learned, and also will include projects that I want to eventually launch.

Also, I am planning my career to learn more about data engineering, infrastructure as code, and AWS services, which will appear in later projects.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on website development, and am currently researching the tech stack and deployment methods for some personal projects.
